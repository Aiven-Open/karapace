# Ignoring files that are specific to a given checkout, these change based on
# the user commands and not on the repository history. They are not important
# to determine the state of the repository and would invalidate the cache
# layer.
#
# - .git/logs/HEAD - command history
# - .git/index - binary file for the current index, very important for a
#    working repository, not interesting for our image

.git/logs/HEAD
.git/index
