Overview
========

Karapace supports the storing of schemas in a central repository, which clients can access to
serialize and deserialize messages. The schemas also maintain their own version histories and can be
checked for compatibility between their different respective versions.

Karapace rest provides a RESTful interface to your Apache Kafka cluster, allowing you to perform tasks such
as producing and consuming messages and perform administrative cluster work, all the while using the
language of the WEB.

Features
========

* Drop in replacement both on pre-existing Schema Registry / Kafka Rest Proxy client and
  server-sides
* Moderate memory consumption
* Asynchronous architecture based on aiohttp
* Supports Avro and JSON Schema. Protobuf development is tracked with `Issue 67`_.
* Leader/Replica architecture for HA and load balancing.

.. _Issue 67: https://github.com/aiven/karapace/issues/67

Compatibility details
---------------------

Karapace is compatible with Schema Registry 6.1.1 on API level. When a new version of SR is released, the goal is
to support it in a reasonable time. Karapace supports all operations in the API.
The goal is that even the error messages are the same as in Schema Registry, which cannot be always fully guaranteed.

Setup
=====

Using Docker
------------

To get you up and running with the latest build of Karapace, a docker image is available::

  # Fetch the latest build from main branch
  docker pull ghcr.io/aiven/karapace:develop

  # Fetch the latest release
  docker pull ghcr.io/aiven/karapace:latest

An example setup including configuration and Kafka connection is available as docker-compose example::

    docker-compose -f ./container/docker-compose.yml up -d

Then you should be able to reach two sets of endpoints:

* Karapace schema registry on http://localhost:8081
* Karapace REST on http://localhost:8082

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each configuration key can be overridden with an environment variable prefixed with ``KARAPACE_``,
exception being configuration keys that actually start with the ``karapace`` string. For example, to
override the ``bootstrap_uri`` config value, one would use the environment variable
``KARAPACE_BOOTSTRAP_URI``. Here_ you can find an example configuration file to give you an idea
what you need to change.

.. _`Here`: https://github.com/aiven/karapace/blob/master/karapace.config.json

Source install
--------------

Alternatively you can do a source install using::

  python setup.py install

Quickstart
==========

To register the first version of a schema under the subject "test" using Avro schema::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
    --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"Obj\", \"fields\":[{\"name\": \"age\", \"type\": \"int\"}]}"}' \
    http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key/versions
  {"id":1}

To register a version of a schema using JSON Schema, one needs to use `schemaType` property::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
    --data '{"schemaType": "JSON", "schema": "{\"type\": \"object\",\"properties\":{\"age\":{\"type\": \"number\"}},\"additionalProperties\":true}"}' \
    http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key-json-schema/versions
  {"id":2}

To list all subjects (including the one created just above)::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/subjects
  ["test-key"]

To list all the versions of a given schema (including the one just created above)::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key/versions
  [1]

To fetch back the schema whose global id is 1 (i.e. the one registered above)::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/schemas/ids/1
  {"schema":"{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"age\",\"type\":\"int\"}],\"name\":\"Obj\",\"type\":\"record\"}"}

To get the specific version 1 of the schema just registered run::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key/versions/1
  {"subject":"test-key","version":1,"id":1,"schema":"{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"age\",\"type\":\"int\"}],\"name\":\"Obj\",\"type\":\"record\"}"}

To get the latest version of the schema under subject test-key run::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/subjects/Kafka-value/versions/latest
  {"subject":"test-key","version":1,"id":1,"schema":"{\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"age\",\"type\":\"int\"}],\"name\":\"Obj\",\"type\":\"record\"}"}

In order to delete version 10 of the schema registered under subject "test-key" (if it exists)::

  $ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key/versions/10
   10

To Delete all versions of the schema registered under subject "test-key"::

  $ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-key
  [1]

Test the compatibility of a schema with the latest schema under subject "test-key"::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
    --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"int\"}"}' \
    http://localhost:8081/compatibility/subjects/test-key/versions/latest
  {"is_compatible":true}

Get current global backwards compatibility setting value::

  $ curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/config
  {"compatibilityLevel":"BACKWARD"}

Change compatibility requirements for all subjects where it's not
specifically defined otherwise::

  $ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
    --data '{"compatibility": "NONE"}' http://localhost:8081/config
  {"compatibility":"NONE"}

Change compatibility requirement to FULL for the test-key subject::

  $ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" \
    --data '{"compatibility": "FULL"}' http://localhost:8081/config/test-key
  {"compatibility":"FULL"}

List topics::

  $ curl "http://localhost:8081/topics"

Get info for one particular topic::

  $ curl "http://localhost:8081/topics/my_topic"

Produce a message backed up by schema registry::

  $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.avro.v2+json" -X POST -d \
    '{"value_schema": "{\"namespace\": \"example.avro\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"simple\", \"fields\": \
    [{\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\"}]}", "records": [{"value": {"name": "name0"}}]}' http://localhost:8081/topics/my_topic

Create a consumer::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" \
    --data '{"name": "my_consumer", "format": "avro", "auto.offset.reset": "earliest"}' \
    http://localhost:8081/consumers/avro_consumers

Subscribe to the topic we previously published to::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --data '{"topics":["my_topic"]}' \
    http://localhost:8081/consumers/avro_consumers/instances/my_consumer/subscription

Consume previously published message::

  $ curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.avro.v2+json" \
    http://localhost:8081/consumers/avro_consumers/instances/my_consumer/records?timeout=1000

Commit offsets for a particular topic partition::

  $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" --data '{}' \
    http://localhost:8081/consumers/avro_consumers/instances/my_consumer/offsets

Delete consumer::

  $ curl -X DELETE -H "Accept: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json" \
    http://localhost:8081/consumers/avro_consumers/instances/my_consumer

Backing up your Karapace
========================

Karapace natively stores its data in a Kafka topic the name of which you can
configure freely but which by default is called _schemas.

Karapace includes a tool to backing up and restoring data. To back up, run::

  karapace_schema_backup get --config karapace.config.json --location schemas.log

You can also back up the data by using Kafka's Java console
consumer::

  ./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server brokerhostname:9092 --topic _schemas --from-beginning --property print.key=true --timeout-ms 1000 1> schemas.log

Restoring Karapace from backup
==============================

Your backup can be restored with Karapace by running::

  karapace_schema_backup restore --config karapace.config.json --location schemas.log

Or Kafka's Java console producer can be used to restore the data
to a new Kafka cluster.

You can restore the data from the previous step by running::

  ./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list brokerhostname:9092 --topic _schemas --property parse.key=true < schemas.log

Also, it appears there is quite a bit of variation on subsequent runs, especially for the lower numbers, so once
more exact measurements are required, it's advised we increase the total req count to something like 500K

We'll focus on avro serialization only after this round, as it's the more expensive one, plus it tests the entire stack

Consuming RAM
-------------

A basic push pull test , with 12 connections on the publisher process and 3 connections on the subscriber process, with a
10 minute duration. The publisher has the 100 ms timeout and 100 max_bytes parameters set on each request so both processes have work to do
Heap size limit is set to 256M on Rest proxy

Commands
========

Once installed, the ``karapace`` program should be in your path.  It is the
main daemon process that should be run under a service manager such as
``systemd`` to serve clients.

Configuration keys
==================

Keys to take special care are the ones needed to configure Kafka and advertised_hostname.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - ``advertised_hostname``
     - ``socket.gethostname()``
     - The hostname being advertised to other instances of Karapace that are attached to the same Kafka group.  All nodes within the cluster need to have their ``advertised_hostname``'s set so that they can all reach each other.
   * - ``bootstrap_uri``
     - ``localhost:9092``
     - The URI to the Kafka service where to store the schemas and to run
       coordination among the Karapace instances.
   * - ``client_id``
     - ``sr-1``
     - The ``client_id`` name by which the Karapace will use when coordinating with
       other Karapaces who is master. The one with the name that sorts as the
       first alphabetically is chosen as master from among the services with
       master_eligibility set to true.
   * - ``consumer_enable_autocommit``
     - ``True``
     - Enable auto commit on rest proxy consumers
   * - ``consumer_request_timeout_ms``
     - ``11000``
     - Rest proxy consumers timeout for reads that do not limit the max bytes or provide their own timeout
   * - ``consumer_request_max_bytes``
     - ``67108864``
     - Rest proxy consumers maximum bytes to be fetched per request
   * - ``fetch_min_bytes``
     - ``-1``
     - Rest proxy consumers minimum bytes to be fetched per request. ``-1`` means no limit
   * - ``group_id``
     - ``schema-registry``
     - The Kafka group name used for selecting a master service to coordinate the storing of Schemas.
   * - ``master_eligibility``
     - ``true``
     - Should the service instance be considered for promotion to be the master
       service. Reason to turn this off would be to have an instances of Karapace
       running somewhere else for HA purposes but which you wouldn't want to
       automatically promote to master if the primary instances were to become
       unavailable.
   * - ``producer_compression_type``
     - ``None``
     - Type of compression to be used by rest proxy producers
   * - ``producer_acks``
     - ``1``
